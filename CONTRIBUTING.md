Fork the repository to your account. Clone the repository on your machine, checkout to `dev` and start development.

## Rules

Always make changes on the `dev` branch. And make the pull requests to `dev`.

Avoid using external dependencies.

Follow the naming and groups described in the [API documentation](https://clickup.com/api/)

Try put on front of commit the action that was made on code. Like

- For add use : ADD method foo to List

and so on.
